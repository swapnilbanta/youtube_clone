Debouncing :
when you are doing very fast . It will skipping some of the events
when you are typing very fast . the difference bewteen key stroke is high
typing slow = 200ms
typing fast = 30m

performance 
-iphone pro max - 14 letter * 10000  =14000 
- with debouncing  = 3 API  call *1000  = 3000

-Debouncing   with 200ms
- if difference between  2 key strokes is <200ms -Decline the api call
> 200ms make an api call in it. 
> show the result
